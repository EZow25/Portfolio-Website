            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>Engineers in the lab worked on building a robot for businesses to inspect the insides of their pipes.
                Data from the robot needs to be clearly presented to business professionals, who want to view the pipe data and annotate damaged sections.
                <h3>But the user interface lacks usability and aesthetic appeal compared to its competitors.</h3> <br>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                I worked closely with my project manager to <b>fully redesign the UI</b>, bearing in mind key usability principles (consistency, visual hierarchy, etc.)
                and minimal, modern design trends.<br>
                I also <b>advocated for, organized, and conducted a heuristic-based usability test</b> to identify any pain points and
                further refine the prototype before I began development.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                From analyzing the existing portal design and speaking with previous users, I identified <b>5 areas of improvements</b>.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>
                Now that I had a solid understanding of the portal and what to focus on for the redesign, 
                I moved into brainstorming, rapidly sketching, and conducting several competitive and comparative analyses using Dribbble.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                With the sketches finalized, I had some solid structures and a low fidelity mock-up. 
                The next step was to start nailing down the aesthetics and create something higher fidelity in Figma.

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted a heuristic-based usability test with 6 lab members to measure the design's usability.
                Participants were asked to rank the design across 7 different heuristics, similar to the 5 areas of improvement. <br>
                Notably, we discovered a major flaw in the user flow. Participants felt the landing page shouldn't be the map, <b>it should be the page
                that shows all the jobs</b> since jobs held all the important data users would inspect and annotate.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                After making the changes from the usability test and with limited time left, I began developing the data display page.
                I used the Next.js framework for its ease of use, built-in routing, and my extensive experience using it.

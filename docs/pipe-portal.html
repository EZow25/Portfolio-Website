            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Existing pipe systems are built to last a century. <em>Those same pipes were built a century ago.</em></h3>
            <h3></h3>

            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>Engineers in the lab worked on building a robot for businesses to inspect the insides of their pipes.
                Data from the robot needs to be clearly presented to business professionals, who want to view the pipe data and annotate damaged sections.
                <h3>But the user interface lacks usability and aesthetic appeal compared to its competitors.</h3> <br>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>To investigate the current solution, I conducted a tear-down of the existing portal.<br>
                I also talked with previous users about how they used it and their pain points.
            </h3>
            <p>
                This helped me understand key concepts in the problem space. For example, I learned that jobs in the portal were where the data was stored, and jobs were organized into work orders. More notably, however, 
                I discovered several usability issues within the portal.

                From these, I synthesized 5 areas of improvement.

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>
                Armed with crucial background information and a course of action, I moved into brainstorming.
            </p>
            <h3>
                I sketched out page structures and conducted competitive and comparative analyses for inspiration.
            </h3>
            <p>
                This would nail down user flows and the portal's information architecture without being burdened by aesthetics.
                I made sure to keep the 5 areas of improvement in mind. For example, I made the annotation feature more explicit
                with a visible, clearly labeled button.

                It would now be easier think about aesthetics with a higher fidelity prototype in Figma.

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted a heuristic-based usability test with 6 lab members to measure the design's usability.
                Participants were asked to rank the design across 7 different heuristics, similar to the 5 areas of improvement. <br>
                <b>We discovered a major flaw in the user flow.</b> 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Participants felt the landing page shouldn't be the map, it should be the page
                that shows all the jobs since jobs hold the data that users want to inspect and annotate.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                After making the changes from the usability test and with limited time left, I began developing the data display page.
                I used the Next.js framework for its ease of use, built-in routing, and my extensive experience with it.

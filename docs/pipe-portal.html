                    Redesigned the <b>Pipe Portal, a tool for businesses with crucial gas 
                    pipeline infrastructure to access data from pipe inspections.</b> 
                    This would assist them in pipeline maintenance to prevent dangerous and potentially fatal explosions.

                    Enhanced the Portal's usability based on key heuristics, scoring about 4 - 5 out of 5 on each in usability testing.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Existing pipe systems are built to last a century. 
                <br><em>Those same pipes were built a century ago.</em>
            </h3>
            <p>
                To address this pressing issue, a team of engineers in Carnegie Mellon University's Biorobotics Lab built a robot 
                that can <b>inspect pipes and provide its gathered data through the Pipe Portal.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>However, the Portal's poor usability and aesthetic appeal compared to competitors would discourage companies from adopting it.</h3>
            <img src="assets/pipe_portal/portalv1-site.png" alt="Pipe Portal V1" />
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>This was my main project as a full-time employee of the lab. Going into it, I knew this project would be difficult.</p>
            <h3>
                In a lab of engineers, I wouldn't have anyone with a user-centered 
                background to turn to for guidance or strong feedback on my work.
            </h3> 
            <p> 
                Talks with my supervisor and PM revealed yet another obstacle:
            </p>
            <h3>I wouldn't have direct access to actual end-users of the Portal, who were extremely busy business professionals.</h3>
            <p>
                Internal team members who had used the Portal for testing would have to do. My project manager was also free about twice a week for help or 
                design reviews. I would just have to be super particular about how I explained my design decisions, since my PM was an engineer.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>My first meeting with my PM was a walkthrough of the existing portal.</h3>
            <p>
                This was super helpful for getting me familiar with the Portal, its main features, and how end users were expected to use them. 
            </p>
            <h3>To investigate the current solution more in-depth, I conducted an audit of it.</h3>
            <p>
                As I traversed the portal, I tracked key features to bring over in my redesign, glaring usability issues, and any initial improvement ideas. 
                These were noted in a report I sent over to my PM for review.
            </p>
            <h3>I also made sure to ask my PM for any insights into end users who she had access to.</h3>
            <b> I learned they consisted of 3 groups: </b>
            <img src="assets/pipe_portal/users.jpg" alt="Users" class="sectionGraphic"/>
            <p> This meant I was building a 2B product whose users likely want <b>a quick, practical, and actionable experience</b> over a trendy, minimalist aesthetic. </p>
            <h3>With that in mind, I looked at how the current portal failed to support that, then synthesized what heuristics of a new portal would.</h3>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p> After finding some direction, it was time to start sketching ideas. </p>
            <h3>
                Sketching kept me focused on the information architecture rather than the aesthetics, which would be the foundation for that efficient experience.
            </h3>
            <p> One of the biggest changes was to the old map sidebar. </p>
            <h3> I redistributed tabs into separate pages since some involved complex tasks requiring that whole page size. </h3>
            <p> Notably, I moved the Jobs section where users would find the pipe data to inspect and annotate, including video recordings from the robot as it traversed pipes. </p>

            <img src="assets/pipe_portal/mapsketch.jpg" alt="Map Sketch" class="sectionImg" />
            <h3>
                I also restructured the data display page to make videos more visible and annotating functionality more obvious.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Users use the video with other metrics to identify flaws within the pipe, which they mark by adding observations at certain times in the videos. 
                Thus, I allocated a large portion of the page just to videos and playback controls, then added a bright, clearly marked “Add Observation” button in the top right.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/pipe_portal/datasketch.png" alt="Data Sketch" class="sectionImg"/>
            <h3>
                In retrospect, this stage would've been a great time to get feedback beyond my project manager's.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, after several iterations and design reviews with my PM, the sketches were finalized and I was ready to move into building a higher fidelity prototype in Figma. 
                I kept the color scheme neutral to give it that professional, polished appearance while still following the lab's branding, leveraging CMU's red to make important elements more obvious.

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted a heuristic-based usability test with 6 lab members. Some had used the old portal
                before, while others were internal project team members. 
                Participants were asked to rank the design across 7 different heuristics, similar to the 5 areas of improvement. <br> 
            </p>
            <h3>
                I chose a heuristics based test because participants were engineers without any UX background, 
                so I wanted to give them a simple, more objective way to measure the interface's usability that also ties back to the
                previous 5 areas of improvement. 
            </h3>
            <p>
                I was also careful with how I explained each heuristic and ran through explanations with my PM beforehand, who had a similar non-UX background just like the participants.
            </p>
            <p>The evaluation was valuable, as <b>we discovered a major flaw in the user flow.</b></p>
            <h3>
                Participants felt the landing page shouldn't be the map, it should be the page
                that shows all the jobs since jobs hold the data that users want to inspect and annotate.
            </h3>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                After making the changes from the usability test and with limited time left, I began developing the data display page.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Since I was running out of time before my Master's studies, I focused purely on implementing the data display page.
                This page had the most complicated and most crucial functionality.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Due to its ease of use, built-in routing, and my extensive experience with it, I selected the Next.js framework.
            </p>

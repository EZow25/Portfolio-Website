            When I wasn't doing work for my research internship at CMU, I would often explore the streets of Pittsburgh. 
            I found myself enjoying taking photos, and it's since been something I love to do since, especially when things 
            are stressful and I need a reminder of the beauty that can be found in life.

            Finding my parent's old digital camera (Olympus D560 Zoom for those curious) has been a game changer. Before, I just used my phone,
            but there's something about having a specialized device for photography that makes taking pictures so much more enjoyable.

            Drawing was one of my favorite things as a kid, and something I've gotten back into the past few years while searching for new hobbies. 
            My drawings back then were always chaotic and maximalist, simply because I enjoyed the freedom of drawing whatever came to my mind that I thought looked cool. 
            I maintain that sentiment to this day, but mixed with my newfound intrigue for typography and graffiti.

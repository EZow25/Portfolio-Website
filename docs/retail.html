                <p>
                    Sponsored by tech and business consultancy Slalom, my team <b>investigated the 
                    role of AI in modern shopping and strategies to keep brands visible and accurately represented</b>, 
                    then used findings to <b>design Birdie, an AI-powered fashion shopping platform.</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    This was a semester-long project within the GTech Master's in Human-Computer Interaction program's core course, Psychological Research Methods in HCI.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are becoming widely used by online shoppers.<br> 
                However, <em>they aren't tailored for shopping assistance</em> and <em>diminish brand's control over their visibility and representation to consumers.</em>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Looking at <b>Adobe's 2025 survey of 5,000 US consumers</b>:

            <p>
                Slalom asked us to <b>discover how brands can take back this control and maintain their relevance in an era of AI.</b><br> 
                However, we also wanted to <b>design something to help shoppers best leverage the power of GenAI</b>.

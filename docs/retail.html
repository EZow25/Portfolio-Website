                    Sponsored by tech and business consultancy Slalom, my team <b>investigated the

            <h2>Design: Ideation</h2>
            <p>At this point, we struggled with differing expectations amongst our sponsors and the course project.</p>
            <h3>
                Slalom wanted to help their retail clients be visible and represented through AI, and we needed to design a product for our target users using all our research.
            </h3>
            <p>Each of my team members put a lot of thought into some design ideas.</p>
            <h3>
                I came up with an AI-powered, fashion shopping platform on desktop, where users could discover a variety of brands and products tailored to their needs and preferences.
            </h3>
            <p>One of my team members sketched it up, as seen below.</p>
            <div class="inlineImgs">
                <img src="assets/birdie/birdiesketchlanding.png" alt="Birdie Sketch: Landing Page" class="sectionImgSm"/>

            <p>Across all user tests on different sketches of our ideas, this one was consistently most liked.</p>
            <h3>Users liked how it was like a one-stop-shop for clothing shopping. They could do everything, from searching for items to researching certain products or brands.</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design: Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                From there, we upped the fidelity with some Figma wireframes. This got us to think more about turning feedback from users into a strong information architecture,
                containing easy-to-use features for all necessary user flows.
